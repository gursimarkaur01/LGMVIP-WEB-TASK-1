# LGMVIP-WEB-TASK-1
Welcome to the Task 1 repository of LGMVIP-WEB! This project is a web-based TO-DO List WebApp. 
It's designed to help users maintain a record of their essential tasks or jobs of the day in an interactive way where they can either select pre-written tasks again or add a new option to the list. 
It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This repository contains all the code, documentation, and resources related to Task 1 of the web development projects I worked on during my internship.
