# LGMVIP-WEB-TASK-1
Welcome to the Task 1 repository of LGMVIP-WEB ! This project is a web-based quiz that generates random multiplication questions. It's designed to help users to maintain a record of there important tasks/jobs of the day in an interactive way where they can either select pre-written task again or can Add a new option to the list. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This repository contains all the code, documentation, and resources related to the Task1 of my web development projects that I am working on during my internship.
